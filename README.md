## Hey, I'm Slashy - your friendly neighborhood custom-command bot!

The code for this bot exists because I'm like the open-source community, so feel free to run it yourself, or submit pull requests to improve it.

You can get help on using the bot with the `/help` command in any of the servers Slashy is in, or in Slashy's DM-s.

## Invite

Click [right here](https://hey.imkez.com/slashy-invite) to add Slashy to your server.

## Help
Below are all the commands you can currently use.

<u>Underlined</u> commands mean that only members with the `Administrator` permission can use them. Will be customizable in the future.

<> are required arguments and [] are optional arguments.

The following command names are reserved and can't be used to prevent confusion: `edit`, `add`, `remove`, `slashystats`, `help`, `list`
| Command 	| Usage 	| Description 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| help 	| `/help` 	| You guessed it, shows you this, but in Discord! 	|
| add 	| `/add <name> <reply> [description]` 	| Add new slash commands.<br>The description field is optional, with the bot using **A command made by Slashy** by default. 	|
| remove 	| `/remove <name>` 	| Remove existing slash commands. 	|
| edit 	| `/edit <name> [new-reply] [new-description]` 	| Edit an existing command's reply, description, or both. 	|

## Notes
This repository isn't and won't be updated with the realtime production code the bot is using, and will usually be a version or so late. I honestly don't have the time to push every single tiny change every time.
